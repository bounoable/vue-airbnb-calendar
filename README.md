# Vue Airbnb Calendar

![Vue Airbnb Calendar](.github/recording.gif)

[Examples](https://bounoable.github.io/vue-airbnb-calendar-examples/)

This calendar / datepicker is inspired by the Datepicker from Airbnb ([react-dates](https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates)) and the existing [vue-airbnb-style-calendar](https://github.com/MikaelEdebro/vue-airbnb-style-datepicker). Unfortunately that project uses 1.x version of [date-fns](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns), so I couldn't use it in my projects.

This library is created with Vue's [composition API](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api).
You need to install it to make the calendar work. Learn more about the composition API [here](https://vue-composition-api-rfc.netlify.com/).

```ts
import CompositionApi from '@vue/composition-api'

Vue.use(CompositionApi)
```

## Installation

### Package Manager

```sh
yarn add vue-airbnb-calendar
```

or

```sh
npm install vue-airbnb-calendar --save
```

### CDN

<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@vue/composition-api/dist/vue-composition-api.umd.js"></script>

    return { options }
  }

## Plugins

Without any plugins you basically just got an infinite scrolling calendar.
Currently the only available plugin is the Selection Plugin.

## Selection Plugin

The Selection Plugin provides a range datepicker with customizable color schemes and options to control the calendar items/days.

### Supported features:
- Range datepicker
- Custom color scheme
- Disabling of dates (min/max date, date ranges, custom function)
- Highlight dates (custom function)

### Installation

```html
<script>
import { Options, plugins } from 'vue-airbnb-calendar'

export default {
  data() {
    const options: Options = {
      plugins: [
        plugins.SelectionPlugin({
          // Plugin options ...
        })
      ]
    }

    return { options }
  }
}
</script>

<template>

## Contributing

This calendar was created out of a personal need, therefore new features / plugins will likely also emerge from my personal needs. Feel free to create pull requests, but keep in mind that the core of the calendar should stay small and simple. Rather than adding advanced features directly to the core, try to extend the calendar's API (if you need to) and then create the plugin for the feature.

If you can't contribute to the code by yourself, create an issue and hope for the best ðŸ˜¬
